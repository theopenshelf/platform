# Telemetry & Compliance Policy

## 1. Data Collected
The software includes telemetry to track:
- Monthly active user count
- General usage statistics (feature adoption, error rates)
- No personal or sensitive data is collected

## 2. Opt-Out & Manual Audits
- Users may disable telemetry but must submit **manual user reports** monthly.
- Organizations refusing both telemetry and manual reporting are subject to compliance reviews.

## 3. Enforcement
- If telemetry or reporting shows >100 users, a commercial license is required.
- Non-compliance leads to a **30-day resolution period** before enforcement actions.
